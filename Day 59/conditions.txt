To check FIFO full and empty conditions in another domain, we have two ways.

Way 1
Convert received gray code formatted pointers to binary format and then check for the full and empty conditions.

#FIFO full condition
g2b_converter g2b_wr(g_rptr_sync, b_rptr_sync);
wrap_around = b_rptr_sync[PTR_WIDTH] ^ b_wptr[PTR_WIDTH];
wfull = wrap_around & (b_wptr[PTR_WIDTH-1:0] == b_rptr_sync[PTR_WIDTH-1:0]);

#FIFO empty condition
g2b_converter g2b_rd(g_wptr_sync, b_wptr_sync);
rempty = (b_wptr_sync == b_rptr_next);

Way 2
Check for full and empty conditions directly with the help of gray coded write and read pointer received. 
This is efficient as it does not need extra hardware for converting gray-coded write and read pointers to equivalent binary forms.

#FIFO full condition
wfull = (g_wptr_next == {~g_rptr_sync[PTR_WIDTH:PTR_WIDTH-1], g_rptr_sync[PTR_WIDTH-2:0]});

#FIFO empty condition
rempty = (g_wptr_sync == g_rptr_next);
